# Deep-Learning-Practice
Personal practice with Deep Learning algorithms in both Python and R, including: 

- Supervised learning: ANN (Bank Customer Exit Classifier); CNN (Basic dog/cat image classifier); RNN (Stock price predictor)
- Unsupervised learning: Self-organizing map (Credit card fraud detector); Boltzmann Machine (Movie Recommender); AutoEncoder (Movie Recommender). 

Some files will have the research paper baed on which I practiced the algorithm. I will update further as I learn more research and gain deeper understanding of the field.
